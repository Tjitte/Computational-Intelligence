or each iteration{
 	for each ant{
		 look to the possible next moves and create a vector [1x4]
		 put ones if the next move is a possible one
		 put two if the move is possible but in your visited vector
		 
		 create pherVector [1x4] and calculate the pher on each next possible move
		 create chanceVector[1x4] and calculate the chances of the moves
		 for each 1 in the vector
		 	look for pher on the next move and fill it in the pherVector
			
		 take a random number and choose a move regarding to the pher on each possible next move.
		 
		 if no moves possible but a move that is to a already visited spot{
		 	take move anyway and get back to last choice point

	put the pheromones in pherMatrix

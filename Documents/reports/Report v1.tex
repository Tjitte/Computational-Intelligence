  \section{Questions}
  Here we will answer the questions of the first assignment.
  
  \subsection{}
  Our group will be using 10 input neurons because the objects have ten different features.
  
  \subsection{}
  The script should have 7 output neurons because there are 7 different categories for the objects.
  Hence, this is the amount of possible outcomes.
  
  \subsection{}
  For now, we have a hidden layer with 12 hidden neurons. There are many opinions about how many neurons to take, so we used the following formula: \\ \\ $\# \:hidden \:neurons = \frac{2} {3} \times (\# \:input \:neurons + \# \:output \:neurons) $
  
  \subsection{}
  We use the sigmoid function because our network should be able to deal with non-linear combinations of weights. Sigmoid function gives us values between 0 and 1 instead of a value of a flat 0 or a flat 1, which is given by the step function.
  
  \subsection{}

  \\ Between the first and the second layer we have drawn all the connections, but between the second and the third we didn't just to keep a clear overview. Only the connections to the first output neuron are drawn, but of course each of output neurons is connected with each of the neurons in the hidden layer.
  
  \subsection{}
  Deviding your dataset into a training set, a validation set and a test set is very useful to overcome the problem of over fitting. You train your network with the training set to adjust the weights. Then you use the accuracy of the validation set to compare with the accuracy of the training set to determine if overfitting is occurring. When you finally have a good set weights, you use the test set to check the actual performance of the weights on this data which has not been used before.
  
  \subsection{}
  You can test the program's performance by using a test set as mentioned above. 
  
  \subsection{}
 If at any moment overfitting is occurring, you should stop training your weights on the training set. If overfitting happens, you are training your weights too hard on the training set and therefore your set of weights won't be that accurate on the test set or other sets that haven't been introduced before.
  
  \subsection{}
  With different initial weights the program could get the same result.This happens when 2 different sets of initialized weights get trained, but the hill-climbing-algorithm finds the same (local) minimum for both sets of weights. On the other hand, the different initializations of the weights
 can lead to different outcomes when the hill-climbing-algorithm finds a different (local) minimum for both sets of weights. That different (local) minimum can be lower than the other (local) minima, which means that the error is lower and thus the performance is better.

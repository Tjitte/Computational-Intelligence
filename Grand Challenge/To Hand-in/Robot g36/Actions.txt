The syntax is the same as in part 2 of assignment 3 with one important difference:
Since each of you will be running around in the same maze, there is no reason to specify a
starting location. So comment out the line(s) of code which print the starting position to
your action file. (Or remove it manually. Just make sure the line disappears from your action
file for the Grand Challenge.)

Also - obviously, your route should be such that your robot’s end position is the exit of the
maze. If your robot does not reach the end, or attempts to walk through the wall, he will
automatically be disqualified.
